                <h2>Sue Townsend - Adrian Mole: From Minor to Major</br>9.5/10</h2>
                <p>Wow, I did not expect to love this so much. It's like a funnier version of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> set in 1980s Britain, and I think it pulled it off better.</p>

                <h2>Art Spiegelman - Maus</br>8.5/10</h2>
                <p>I really enjoyed it, and I know that this completely changed comics as an art form and effectively invented the "graphic novel", etc. etc., it just didn't blow me away like I expected it to. I guess I just felt like more could've been done with it.</p>

                <h2>Ernest Hemingway - The Old Man and the Sea</br>8/10</h2>
                <p>I feel like you could interpret this in a million different ways or just see it as a simple story. I don't know what the intention was here but I found it entertaining regardless. I might be being too generous with this rating for what's really here.</p>

                <h2>Ernest Hemingway - For Whom the Bell Tolls</br>Didn't finish :(</h2>
                <p>How can a story with this epic of a plot be this boring? Might give it another chance one day but I just think this isn’t my thing.</p>

                <h2>Ray Bradbury - Fahrenheit 451</br>3/10</h2>
                <p>"It works even better because we have political correctness now. Political correctness is the real enemy these days. The black groups want to control our thinking and you can’t say certain things. The homosexual groups don’t want you to criticize them. It’s thought control and freedom of speech control."
                </br></p><p style="text-align:center;">- Ray Bradbury, 1994, when asked if the book is still relevant today</p>
                </br>
                <p>
                Originally he said the book was about the dangers of censorship. Then a few years later he said it was actually about the dangers of advancing technology, and then after that he said it's about... the dangers of being told not to say slurs? What? Anyway, the book is well-written I guess, but its ideas are ridiculously shallow. The more I think about it, the dumber it all sounds and the more I hate it. I couldn't imagine how anyone could put it anywhere near something like <i>1984</i> or even <i>Brave New World</i>.
