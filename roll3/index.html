        <h1><u>Roll 3</u></h1>
        <p2>Jan. 2025. Shot on Ilford XP2 400 film and a Minolta Maxxum 5000. Mostly night photos. I messed up a lot of these by taking really long exposures and underestimating the shakiness of my hands. The 5000 doesn't have priority modes so all of these were fully manual without any kind of light meter. My first time using this film, my first time using this camera, and my first time getting scans instead of prints. I like most of the photos in the second half of the roll but wish I hadn't messed up so many on the first half.</p2>
